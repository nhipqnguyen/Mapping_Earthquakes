# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days, then added the data to a map.
I then used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. I also used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Challenge
For the challenge, I visualized the tectonic platesâ€™ location data, then added all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. Finally, I added a third style to the earthquake map beside the streets and sattelite styles.

# Results
Below is a screenshot of the earthquakes map.
