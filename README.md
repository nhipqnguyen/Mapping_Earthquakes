# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. We use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days, then add the data to a map.
We then use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We also use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Challenge
For the challenge, we visulize the tectonic platesâ€™ location data, then add all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. Finally, we add a third style to our earthquake map beside the streets and sattelite styles.

# Results
Below is a screenshot of the earthquakes map.
